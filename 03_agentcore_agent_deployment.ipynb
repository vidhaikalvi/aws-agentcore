    "## Lab 3: Deploy complete solution on AgentCore\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Lab 2 covered packaging and deploying remote tools so agents can call them. Lab 3 builds on that by packaging entire agents, configuring identity so agents can obtain authentication tokens securely, and launching agent runtime sessions in a managed environment. In this lab you will deploy Strands Agents to AgentCore Runtime, configure AgentCore Identity for secure credential management, and explore observability features to monitor agent behavior. You'll package an agent, create credential providers, and launch an agent runtime session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "- Package and deploy an agent to AgentCore Runtime (using `bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit`).\n",
    "- Configure AgentCore Identity credential providers for secure access to tools and resources.\n",
    "- Invoke an agent runtime session and inspect streamed or batched responses.\n",
    "- Use AgentCore observability tools (CloudWatch) to review agent traces and logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key tools & libraries covered\n",
    "- [AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html) - A managed service that hosts and runs the agent. The runtime provides a secure and scalable environment with user session isolation, resource management, and monitoring capabilities.\n",
    "- [AgentCore Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity.html) - A service that enables the agent to assume a secure identity when deployed to a runtime. This identity is used to authenticate and authorize the agent's access to tools, resources, and data.\n",
    "- [bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit](https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit) to simplify building, packaging, and deploying tools\n",
    "- [AgentCore Control Plane API](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agentcore-control.html) used to deploy AgentCore resources such as agents and tools programmatically\n",
    "- [AgentCore DataPlane API](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agentcore.html) used to invoke AgentCore resources programmatically\n",
    "- [AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html) - A set of tools and services that provide insights into the agent's performance, behavior, and interactions. Observability helps in debugging, optimizing, and auditing the agent's operations."

The entrypoint code for the agent can be found in [workspace/kyc_agent/kyc_agent.py](workspace/kyc_agent/kyc_agent.py). The code is similar to what we had in the prior notebook, with a few key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent invocation function is decorated with `@APP.entrypoint`, Here `APP` is an instance of `BedrockAgentCoreApp` class provided by the [AgentCore Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-sdk-python). This decorator marks the function as the main entrypoint for the agent when it is deployed to AgentCore Runtime.\n",

The entrypoint function is also decorated with `@requires_access_token` which will leverage the credential provider we created earlier to obtain OAuth2 access tokens for the tools the agent needs to access. Behind the scenes, it will use a combination of the user's unique identity and the agent's identity to request access tokens from the credential provider.\n",

Alternatively, just as we did in the prior notebook with the KYC MCP tools, we could have also configured OAuth2 based authentication for the agent itself. The difference is with IAM based authentication, we will have to pass a unique `user_id` for each user session when invoking the agent. This `user_id` will be used by AgentCore Identity to uniquely identify the user and issue access tokens accordingly, with Oauth2 based authentication, AgentCore Identity would obtain the user's identity from the JWT token presented during authentication."

    "### AgentCore Observability\n",
    "With the agent deployed on a remote runtime, we can no longer see the logs and traces directly in our local environment. Even if we could, it would not be practical to do so at scale when multiple users are interacting with the agent concurrently. Instead, we can leverage AgentCore Observability features to monitor and debug our agents in a scalable manner. AgentCore Observability provides a number of features including:\n",
    "- **CloudWatch Logs**: All logs generated by the agent and its tools are automatically sent to CloudWatch Logs. This allows us to view and search logs in a centralized location, making it easier to debug issues and monitor agent behavior.\n",
    "- **Agent Level Metrics**: AgentCore Runtime automatically collects and publishes metrics about the agent's performance and behavior to CloudWatch Metrics. This includes metrics such as request latency, error rates, and resource utilization.\n",
    "- **Session Level Metrics**: In addition to agent level metrics, AgentCore Runtime also collects and publishes session level metrics providing insights into individual user sessions.\n",
    "- **Tracing**: AgentCore Runtime integrates with AWS X-Ray to provide distributed tracing capabilities giving insights into the agent's interactions with its tools and resources. This helps in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cell below to generate a direct link to the GenAI Observability dashboard in CloudWatch where you can explore logs, metrics, and traces for the deployed agent."

    "In this lab you learned how to deploy a complete agent solution using AgentCore Runtime and AgentCore Identity. You packaged an agent, configured secure credential management, launched an agent runtime session, and explored observability features to monitor agent behavior. With these skills, you can now build and deploy scalable, secure AI agents using AgentCore services."
